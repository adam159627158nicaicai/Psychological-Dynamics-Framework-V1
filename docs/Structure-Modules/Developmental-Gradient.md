Developmental Gradient Layer (Public V1)

Structural outline only. Full mechanism excluded.

⸻

1. Definition

The developmental gradient layer describes the long-term maturation path of identity stability.
It models how the self evolves through predictable stages driven by:
	•	increasing interpretative flexibility
	•	widening experiential capacity
	•	improved regulation of meaning
	•	integration across modules (structure–meaning–experience)

This layer is not about age, but about functional psychological maturity.

2. Seven-Stage Gradient (Public Outline)

Stage 1 — Reactive Self
	•	Identity dominated by immediate emotions
	•	Meaning highly unstable
	•	Structure easily collapses
	•	High sensitivity, low coherence

Stage 2 — Narrative Self
	•	Begins forming stable personal stories
	•	Meaning module over-dominant
	•	Experiences filtered through fixed narratives
	•	Prone to rigid certainty patterns

Stage 3 — Adaptive Self
	•	Structure stabilizes
	•	Experience used to update meaning
	•	Improved behavioral flexibility
	•	Begins balancing energy across modules

Stage 4 — Metacognitive Self
	•	Can observe own thoughts and emotions
	•	Early emergence of self-referential loop
	•	Meaning becomes less absolute
	•	Higher adaptability in unstable environments

Stage 5 — Integrative Self
	•	Full cooperation of structure/meaning/experience
	•	High resilience
	•	Identity continuity maintained across contexts
	•	Significant reduction of reactive cycles

Stage 6 — Generative Self
	•	Identity becomes self-renewing
	•	Meaning interpretations remain flexible
	•	Experience is used proactively, not reactively
	•	High creativity and internal autonomy

Stage 7 — Fluid Self (Public simplified version)
	•	Stable identity without rigidity
	•	Minimal over-interpretation
	•	Maintains coherence through rapid self-regulation
	•	This version omits the full technical description

3. Research Notes (for developers & scientists)

The following core mechanisms are intentionally excluded from V1:
	•	detailed stage-transition drivers
	•	recursive self-optimization
	•	dynamic gradient collapse modes
	•	long-range identity integration
	•	advanced interpretation-energy coupling

Full descriptions will appear in future technical releases.
