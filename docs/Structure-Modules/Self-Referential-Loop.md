# Self-Referential Stabilization Loop (Public V1)

Structural-level explanation. Core mechanism not included.

---

## 1. Definition

The self-referential loop is the internal feedback system that stabilizes identity over time.
It integrates:

- real-time experience  
- stored interpretations (meaning)  
- structural patterns (self-image, memory clusters)  

Its role is to maintain **continuity of the “I”** across changing emotional and cognitive states.

The loop operates beneath conscious awareness and updates only when stability thresholds are reached.

## 2. Functional Characteristics

### 2.1 Identity Continuity
Maintains a consistent sense of self across shifting emotions, motivations, and contexts.

### 2.2 Stability Thresholding
The loop updates only when:

- experience provides fresh energy  
- meaning produces coherent interpretation  
- structure allows safe reorganization  

If any of the three modules fail, the loop locks into rigid mode.

### 2.3 Error Correction
Detects mismatch between:

- internal self-model  
- external reality feedback  

Small errors are absorbed automatically.  
Large errors trigger reorganization cycles (not public in V1).

## 3. Instability Modes (High-Level)

These mechanisms are simplified; full technical versions remain unpublished.

- **Loop Overclosure**  
  Self-model collapses inward; identity becomes rigid.

- **Loop Underclosure**  
  Identity becomes unstable; external events override internal continuity.

- **Loop Fragmentation**  
  The system attempts parallel self-updates; results in unstable self-states.

## 4. Notes for Researchers / Developers

The following technical components are intentionally excluded from the public version:

- deep correction cycles  
- multi-branch reorganization layers  
- self-consistency engine  
- energy-interpretation mapping layer  

These will be included in mechanism-level documentation in later versions.

This file documents the structural role of the self-referential loop.  
Mechanism layer is intentionally omitted from public release.
