Three-Module System (Structure – Meaning – Experience)

Public Structural Description, Core Mechanism Layer Not Included

This document provides an abstract, non-clinical, non-therapeutic description of the three-module psychological architecture used for identity stability and cognitive dynamics.

This version contains only the structural layer.
The mechanism layer (intrinsic drivers + self-referential loop) is intentionally not included.

⸻

1. Structure Module

Provides internal coordination and regulation capacity.
	•	allocates cognitive resources
	•	integrates signals from meaning and experience
	•	maintains internal continuity
	•	generates behavioral pathways

The structure module does not generate energy; it only distributes it.

⸻

2. Meaning Module

Provides interpretative stability and long-term coherence.
	•	creates explanatory frames
	•	maintains value consistency
	•	regulates long-term behavioral direction
	•	generates certainty gradients

Meaning is powerful but highly reactive. Over-activation leads to rigidity; under-activation leads to collapse.

⸻

3. Experience Module

Provides moment-to-moment energy, motivation and environmental feedback.
	•	supplies emotional energy
	•	anchors attention in real context
	•	drives adaptive behavior
	•	refreshes internal dynamics

Experience cannot be replaced by interpretation. It is the only module that directly interfaces with reality.

4. Balance Principle

The system functions correctly only when:

Experience → supplies energy  
Meaning → stabilizes interpretation  
Structure → allocates & coordinates

Disruption of any module results in predictable instability patterns.

5. Missing Elements in V1 (Intentional)

This document is part of a larger framework.
The following elements are not included in this public release:
	•	intrinsic motivational drivers (“mother-factors”)
	•	self-referential stabilization loop (core of identity evolution)
	•	higher-order regulation layer
	•	developmental gradient (seven-stage model)

These components will be documented in future technical releases.

This file describes the structural layer only. Mechanism layer is not included in this repository.
