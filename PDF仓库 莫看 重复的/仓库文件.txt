ntrinsic Motivational Drivers (Public V1)

Structural-level explanation. Core mechanism not included.

Definition
Intrinsic drivers refer to low-level motivational energies that operate beneath conscious interpretation. They influence: • behavioral activation • attention allocation • emotional responsiveness • long-range self-regulation potential

Intrinsic drivers are pre-meaning, meaning they operate before narrative or value interpretation arises.

⸻

Functional Characteristics • provide baseline motivational pressure (“psychological voltage”) • maintain engagement with tasks and environment • stabilize medium-term psychological dynamics • support the transitions between structural modules (experience ↔ meaning ↔ structure)
Under-supply → apathy, disengagement Over-supply → impulsivity, reactive cycles

⸻

Regulation Principles
Intrinsic drivers remain stable when: 1. Experience module supplies refreshed sensory/emotional input 2. Meaning module avoids over-interpretation 3. Structure module keeps predictable boundaries

If any component collapses, intrinsic drivers become distorted (known instability modes will be published in mechanism-layer releases).

⸻

Notes for Researchers & Developers
This V1 file is structural only. The following are intentionally excluded from the public layer: • core creation loop (self-referential cycle) • high-level regulatory hierarchy • motivational phase transitions • identity stabilization logic

These components define identity evolution and self-consistency formation, and will be released only in future technical documentation.
Developmental Gradient Layer (Public V1)

Structural outline only. Full mechanism excluded.

⸻

Definition
The developmental gradient layer describes the long-term maturation path of identity stability. It models how the self evolves through predictable stages driven by: • increasing interpretative flexibility • widening experiential capacity • improved regulation of meaning • integration across modules (structure–meaning–experience)

This layer is not about age, but about functional psychological maturity.

⸻

Seven-Stage Gradient (Public Outline)
Stage 1 — Reactive Self • Identity dominated by immediate emotions • Meaning highly unstable • Structure easily collapses • High sensitivity, low coherence

Stage 2 — Narrative Self • Begins forming stable personal stories • Meaning module over-dominant • Experiences filtered through fixed narratives • Prone to rigid certainty patterns

Stage 3 — Adaptive Self • Structure stabilizes • Experience used to update meaning • Improved behavioral flexibility • Begins balancing energy across modules

Stage 4 — Metacognitive Self • Can observe own thoughts and emotions • Early emergence of self-referential loop • Meaning becomes less absolute • Higher adaptability in unstable environments

Stage 5 — Integrative Self • Full cooperation of structure/meaning/experience • High resilience • Identity continuity maintained across contexts • Significant reduction of reactive cycles

Stage 6 — Generative Self • Identity becomes self-renewing • Meaning interpretations remain flexible • Experience is used proactively, not reactively • High creativity and internal autonomy

Stage 7 — Fluid Self (Public simplified version) • Stable identity without rigidity • Minimal over-interpretation • Maintains coherence through rapid self-regulation • This version omits the full technical description

⸻

Research Notes (for developers & scientists)
The following core mechanisms are intentionally excluded from V1: • detailed stage-transition drivers • recursive self-optimization • dynamic gradient collapse modes • long-range identity integration • advanced interpretation-energy coupling

Full descriptions will appear in future technical releases.
Self-Referential Stabilization Loop (Public V1)
Structural-level explanation. Core mechanism not included.

1. Definition
The self-referential loop is the internal feedback system that stabilizes identity over time. It integrates:

real-time experience
stored interpretations (meaning)
structural patterns (self-image, memory clusters)
Its role is to maintain continuity of the “I” across changing emotional and cognitive states.

The loop operates beneath conscious awareness and updates only when stability thresholds are reached.

2. Functional Characteristics
2.1 Identity Continuity
Maintains a consistent sense of self across shifting emotions, motivations, and contexts.

2.2 Stability Thresholding
The loop updates only when:

experience provides fresh energy
meaning produces coherent interpretation
structure allows safe reorganization
If any of the three modules fail, the loop locks into rigid mode.

2.3 Error Correction
Detects mismatch between:

internal self-model
external reality feedback
Small errors are absorbed automatically.
Large errors trigger reorganization cycles (not public in V1).

3. Instability Modes (High-Level)
These mechanisms are simplified; full technical versions remain unpublished.

Loop Overclosure
Self-model collapses inward; identity becomes rigid.

Loop Underclosure
Identity becomes unstable; external events override internal continuity.

Loop Fragmentation
The system attempts parallel self-updates; results in unstable self-states.

4. Notes for Researchers / Developers
The following technical components are intentionally excluded from the public version:

deep correction cycles
multi-branch reorganization layers
self-consistency engine
energy-interpretation mapping layer
These will be included in mechanism-level documentation in later versions.

This file documents the structural role of the self-referential loop.
Mechanism layer is intentionally omitted from public release.
System Coherence Layer (Public V1)

Structural-layer summary. Full mechanism not included.

⸻

Definition
The system-coherence layer integrates all structural modules into a unified functional identity. It ensures that: • psychological subsystems do not drift apart • interpretation, behavior, and motivation remain synchronized • the self remains continuous across time and context • activation levels remain energetically balanced

The coherence layer is the “glue” that prevents fragmentation of the self.

⸻

Functional Characteristics
2.1 Cross-Module Synchronization

Coordinates timing between: • intrinsic drivers • cognitive routing • meaning formation • experiential updating

Prevents “out-of-phase” dynamics (e.g., emotion rising while interpretation collapses).

⸻

2.2 Global Stability Envelope

Maintains a stable operating range: • prevents runaway meaning amplification • prevents emotional depletion • prevents structural overload • keeps self-referential loop within normal thresholds

If the stability envelope collapses, the system enters instability modes (not public in V1).

⸻

2.3 Contextual Integration

Aligns identity with environment: • updates relevance maps • adjusts motivational priorities • calibrates certainty gradients • suppresses outdated interpretations

Ensures behavior stays adaptive rather than rigid.

⸻

Known Failure Patterns (Simplified for V1)
Full technical versions are not included. Documented public-level failures: • Meaning Over-dominance → rigidity, obsession, narrow interpretation • Experience Under-supply → emotional flattening, detachment • Cognitive Over-routing → analysis paralysis • Driver Instability → impulsivity, oscillating identity • Coherence Drift → fragmented self-states, inconsistent behavior

These patterns are predictable when subsystem synchronization drops.

⸻

Notes for Researchers & Developers
Full system-coherence algorithms are intentionally not included in this version. The following remain unpublished: • cross-layer temporal synchronization • recursive coherence-repair mechanisms • identity continuity propagation model • high-resolution instability matrices

These will appear in future technical releases.

⸻

This file completes the public structural layer. The mechanism layer remains intentionally absent in V1.
Three-Module System (Structure – Meaning – Experience)

Public Structural Description, Core Mechanism Layer Not Included

This document provides an abstract, non-clinical, non-therapeutic description of the three-module psychological architecture used for identity stability and cognitive dynamics.

This version contains only the structural layer. The mechanism layer (intrinsic drivers + self-referential loop) is intentionally not included.

⸻

Structure Module
Provides internal coordination and regulation capacity. • allocates cognitive resources • integrates signals from meaning and experience • maintains internal continuity • generates behavioral pathways

The structure module does not generate energy; it only distributes it.

⸻

Meaning Module
Provides interpretative stability and long-term coherence. • creates explanatory frames • maintains value consistency • regulates long-term behavioral direction • generates certainty gradients

Meaning is powerful but highly reactive. Over-activation leads to rigidity; under-activation leads to collapse.

⸻

Experience Module
Provides moment-to-moment energy, motivation and environmental feedback. • supplies emotional energy • anchors attention in real context • drives adaptive behavior • refreshes internal dynamics

Experience cannot be replaced by interpretation. It is the only module that directly interfaces with reality.

⸻

Balance Principle
The system functions correctly only when:

Experience → supplies energy
Meaning → stabilizes interpretation
Structure → allocates & coordinates

Disruption of any module results in predictable instability patterns.

⸻

Missing Elements in V1 (Intentional)
This document is part of a larger framework. The following elements are not included in this public release: • intrinsic motivational drivers (“mother-factors”) • self-referential stabilization loop (core of identity evolution) • higher-order regulation layer • developmental gradient (seven-stage model)

These components will be documented in future technical releases.

⸻
